# Data-Mining-2017Fall
using python and jupyter notebook

## Dataset
- taipower https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8L9BXtauLRvMFRTSy03aXVVeDA/view?usp=sharing
- weather https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8L9BXtauLRvWW1laTZVTkRVNm8/view?usp=sharing

## HW0 > Data Preprocessing and exploring dataset
- extract the useful features and import the data into database.
- try some SQL task
- visualize the data with python matplotlib
- do some time series data transformation such as offset translation, amplitude scaling,  noise reduction

## HW1 > Association Rule
- define transcation
- use discretization method
- apply FP growth and Apriori
- insights of the discovered rules
- comparison between different methods

## HW2 > Clustering
- Spatial Clustering : use geometric information of locations to do clustering
- Temporal Clustering : use temperature and taipower data to do clustering
- DBSCAN, K means, Gaussian Mixture, Hierarchy Clustering
- comparision between different results and method

## HW3 > Classification, Regression, and other prediction model
- use historical(96 hours) data to predict future(6 hours) data
- randomy split the dataset into training(70%) and testing part(30%)
- do classification including K-nearset-neighbor, naive bayes, random forest, SVC
- do regression including bayesian regression, decision tree regression, SVR
- tune some parameters of some models and compare the differences
